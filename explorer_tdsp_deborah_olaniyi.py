## <font color='crimson'>**A Quick Introduction to Google Colab**</font>

Read below for a Google Colab QuickStart:
- Google Colab is a Python Notebook environment built by Google that's free for all.
- Colab Notebooks are made up of cells; cells can be either *text* or *code* cells. You can click the +code or +text button at the top of the Notebook to create a new cell.
- Text cells use a format called [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). Knowledge of Markdown is not required for this project. However, if you'd like to learn more, [check out this Cheatsheet!](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
- Python code is executed in *code* cells. When you want to run your code, hover your cursor over the square brackets in the top left corner of your code cell. You'll notice a play button pop up! (â–¶) Click the play button to run the code in that cell. Code cells run one at a time.
- The memory shared across your notebook is called the *Runtime*. You can think of a Runtime as a "code session" where everything you create and execute is temporarily stored.
- Runtimes will persist for a short period of time, so you are safe if you need to refresh the page, but Google will shutdown a Runtime after enough time has passed. Everything that you have printed out will remain within your Notebook even if the runtime is disconnected.

If this is your first time using Google Colab, we highly recommend reviewing the [NSDC's *Using Google Colab Guide*](https://nebigdatahub.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NSDC-Data-Science-Projects-Introduction-Using-Google-Colab.pdf) before continuing. For a more comprehensive guide, see [Colab's *Welcome To Colaboratory* walkthrough.](https://colab.research.google.com/github/prites18/NoteNote/blob/master/Welcome_To_Colaboratory.ipynb)

## <font color='crimson'>**An Introduction to Python Programming**</font>

Python is a programming language often used to analyze data.

Python is open-source, which means it's free to use and distribute, even for commercial purposes. Python's versatility allows it to be used for web development, data visualization, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

Python's extensive standard library, along with its powerful third-party packages, enable developers and data scientists to perform a vast array of tasks.

For those looking to dive deeper into Python, here are some valuable resources:
- [The Official Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) â€“ Offers comprehensive guides and reference materials for Python leaners.
- [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) â€“ Provides tutorials and articles for Python developers of all skill levels.
- [PyCon](https://pycon.org/) â€“ The largest annual gathering for the Python community, which is useful for learning from experts and discovering the latest developments in the Python ecosystem.
- [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/) â€“ A book and website by Dr. Charles Severance that offers a free course on Python for beginners.

**Let's review some essential Python Functions!**

Here are some key functions you'll frequently encounter:

1. **`head()`**: This function is crucial for getting a quick overview of your dataset. By default, it returns the first five rows, offering a snapshot of your data's structure and values.

2. **`describe()`**: This provides a summary of the statistical characteristics of your dataset. It's particularly useful for gaining insights into the distribution, mean, standard deviation, and range of numerical columns.

3. **`sum()`**: This calculates the total sum of a column or a series of numbers, proving essential for quick calculations and aggregations in data analysis.

4. **`isnull()`**: This helps identify missing or null values in your dataset, allowing for effective data cleaning and preprocessing.

5. **`value_counts()`**: Understanding the frequency of various values in your dataset is a common task in data science. The `value_counts()` function makes this easy by counting the occurrence of each unique value in a column.

Now that you've reviewed these important concepts, let's dive in to the project!

## <font color='crimson'>**Milestone #1 - Data Preparation**</font>
GOAL: The main goal of this milestone is to set up your environment, install the required packages, learn how to access data and do some basic exploratory data analysis.

**Step 1:** Setting up libraries and installing packages

A **library** is a collection of code that you can use in your programs, while a **package** is a folder that contains libraries or other packages, organized for easy use.

To install a library, we'll use the following format:
```python
 import <library name> as <shortname>
```
We use a *short name* since it is easier to refer to the package to access functions and also to refer to subpackages within the library. Think of it as a nickname for easier reference!
"""

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import folium

"""These are the libraries that will help us throughout this project. We invite you to research each library for a better understanding.

We encourage you to read more about the important and most commonly used libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn and write a few lines in your own words about what they do. [You may use the Data Science Resource Repository (DSRR) to find resources to get started!](https://nebigdatahub.org/nsdc/data-science-resource-repository/)

**TO DO:** Write a few lines about what each library does:




> * Pandas: An online open-sourced library under python thats fast, flexible and easy to use tool used for Data Manipulation and offers different data structures used for this task.
> * Matplotlib: An open-source library that uses Python to help visualize data in a variety of ways. Allows one's data to be presented graphically.
> * Seaborn: An open-source library similar to Matplotbib, providing the user with a more attractive-looking graph. In short, it gives the graph color and works with Matplotbib and Pandas to present data.

**Step 2:** Letâ€™s access our data. We will be using the [NYC OpenData Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95). According to NYC Open Data, "each row represents a crash event. The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC." If you need a reminder on how to upload your dataset, [please review helpful hints here.](https://nebigdatahub.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NSDC-Data-Science-Projects-Introduction-Using-Google-Colab.pdf)

Since this is a large dataset, we highly recommend that you upload your data by [mounting your Google Drive](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/io.ipynb#scrollTo=u22w3BFiOveA).

To mount your Google Drive, begin by finding the folder icon on the left side of your screen. When you click on this folder icon, you will open the Files window. Click on the icon at the top of the Files window that says "Mount Drive" as you hover over it.
"""

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

"""Next, we will read the data using the `pd.read_csv` function.
Ensure that you've downloaded the dataset from NYC OpenData, and uploaded the dataset to your Google Drive.

Hint: Your data's file path describes the location of where your data lives. To locate your data's file path, click on the folder/file-shaped icon on the left side of the Notebook. You'll notice a folder labeled "drive." Search for your Motor Vehicle Collisions Dataset within that folder. Right click on your Dataset to "copy path." Paste that path below.
"""

# TODO: Read the data using pandas read_csv function
data = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/Motor_Vehicle_Collisions_-_Crashes_20250107.csv")

"""**Step 3:** Let's see what the data looks like. We can use the `head` function which returns the first 5 rows of the dataset."""

# TODO: Print the first 5 rows of the data using head function of pandas
data.head()

# TODO: Describe the data using the describe function of pandas
desc_stats = data.describe()
desc_stats

"""The information above is currently formatted in scientific notation. Need a refresher? [Review how to analyze and convert to and from scientific notation here!](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/scientific-notation.html)

1. Latitude & Longitude: The latitude and longitude indicate where the crashes are occurring. However, there are some data points with latitude and longitude values of 0, which is likely due to missing or inaccurate data.

2. Number of Persons Injured: On average, each crash has around 0.305 injuries. The maximum number of injuries in a single crash is 43.

3. Number of Persons Killed: Fatalities are rare, with an average of 0.00146 deaths per crash. The maximum number of deaths in one crash is 8.

4. Number of Pedestrians, Cyclists, and Motorists Injured/Killed: These columns provide a breakdown of the injuries and fatalities by type of individual involved.

5. Collision ID: This is a unique identifier for each crash.

##<font color='crimson'> **Milestone #2 - Data Ethics, Pre-Processing, and Exploration** </font>
GOAL: The main goal of this milestone is to assess the dataset, find missing values, and decide what to do with those missing data points.

**Step 1:**
Before we begin assessing our data for missing values, it is important that we understand the ethical implications surrounding data processing. To best prepare yourself for this module, review one or more of the following resources:
- [Data Science Ethics Flashcard Video Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNs9ZO9jGtUB7XTjXy-ttoo2QSLld9SrV&feature=shared)
- [What Do I Need to Understand about Data Ethics?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efy8htCDueE)
-[Introduction to Data Cleaning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8WkoGLkdTk)

**TO DO:** Based on the resources above and outside knowledge, what are some potential bias issues related to the availability of data from well-resourced communities as compared to under-resourced communities? How might bias show up in our dataset?

> Answer here: Potential bias in the availability of data may be that well-resourced communities have access to a wider range of data compared to under-resourced communities. Considering under-resourced communities don't have sufficient enough resources to provide accurate enough data, this leads to a bias that makes well-resourced communities "more reliable." It's possible that communities with more resources aren't providing accurate data as they reflect a narrow perspective. If one were researching the two communities, it's likely many under-resourced families aren't taken into account because of circumstances that don't allow them to share their position, not fully counting all the families within that community; statistics are wrong, making the data biased when unintentional.

**Step 2:**
Check the dataset for missing values.
"""

#TODO: Leverage the isnull() and sum() functions to find the number of missing values in each column
missing_values = data.isnull().sum()

#TODO: Turn the missing value counts into percentages
missing_values_percentage = (missing_values / len(data)) * 100

#TODO: Return counts and percentages of missing values in each column
missing_data = pd.DataFrame({'Missing Values': missing_values, 'Percentage (%)': missing_values_percentage})
missing_data.sort_values(by='Percentage (%)', ascending=False)

"""Here's an overview of the missing values in the dataset:

Columns like VEHICLE TYPE CODE 5, CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 5, VEHICLE TYPE CODE 4, and so on have a high percentage of missing values. This is expected since not all crashes involve multiple vehicles or factors.

OFF STREET NAME and CROSS STREET NAME have significant missing values. This could be due to crashes occurring in locations where these details aren't applicable or weren't recorded.

ZIP CODE, BOROUGH, and ON STREET NAME also have missing values. This might be due to incomplete data entry or crashes occurring in areas where these specifics aren't easily determinable.

LOCATION, LATITUDE, and LONGITUDE have the same count of missing values, indicating that when one is missing, the others are likely missing as well.

**Step 3:** Create a bar chart to display the top 10 contributing factors (e.g. backing up unsafely, unsafe lane changing, etc.) to crashes within the dataset.
"""

#TODO: Plot a Bar Chart

"""**TO DO:** Besides for "Unspecified," what are the top 3 contributing factors that cause the most crashes?

> *  Driver Inattention/Distraction
> *  Failure to Yield Right-of-Way
> *  Following Too Cloesly

**TO DO:** What recommendations would you make to new and current drivers after assessing the above data?

> *   I would recommend drivers to read the driver's manual that is required for them to obtain a license. It's a fact that many drivers, old and new, believe once they have their license, they can break the rules because they "passed" their test. It's recommended that drivers abide by the law, not using their cellphone when driving and educate themselves on the rules. Reinforce the "Right-of-Way" and "Distance between two cars" rules.

**Step 4:** Now, let's create another bar chart to determine which vehicle types were involved in the most crashes.
"""

plt.xlabel('Vehicle Type', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('Number of crashes', fontsize=14)
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

"""**TO DO:** What are the top 3 vehicles that were most involved in crashes?


> *  Sedan
> *   Station Wagon/Sport Utility Vehicle
> *   Passenger Vehicle

**TO DO:** Why do you think that "Sedan[s]," "Station Wagon[s]," and "Passenger Vehicle[s]" are involved in a larger number of crashes, injuries, and deaths when compared to the rest of the vehicles? (Think outside the box!)


> *  These vehicles are involved in a larger number of crashes because of their popularity. Many vehicles on the road consist of Sedans, Station Wagons/SUVs, and passenger vehicles, with barely any other variety. When discussing about the high volume of sedan crashes, this may be because a sedan is the most popular car for starters; it's possible a large percentage of sedan crashes can be from first-time drivers.

**TO DO:** Review the x-axis of the bar chart you created above. </br>
1) What do you notice? </br>
2) What would you recommend we do to improve the bar chart, based on the x-axis (horizontal axis) and why? </br>
3) What recommendation would you make to those who are collecting and/or inputting data into this dataset?


> *  1)  I notice that the x-axis is very simple, not offering much information other than the type of vehicle. It also repeats vehicles and is not specific on the type of crash.
> *  2)I would recommend removing the repeated vehicles and adding them to the data that is already presented, such as "Station Wagons/Sport Utility Vehicle" and "Taxi." This will allow less confusion and a better representation of which vehicle has the most crashes. In order to look at the timing of crashes, I believe we should look at the hours and amount of crashes during that hour; this gives us further detail on the time frames to focus on. Lastly, we should implement a "Type-of-Crash" along with type of vehicle; this could give us reason as to why there are so many "crashes" under Sedans,SUVs, etc.
> *  3) I would recommend that those inputting the data into this dataset should consider the time each crash occurs and cluster the crashes into specific timeframes, allowing for a better visualization.

**Step 5:**  A DataFrame is a two-dimensional and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). DataFrames allow for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in a structured form, serving as the primary data structure for a multitude of data processing tasks. It is used with Python libraries like pandas.

Let's graph the *types* of crashes within this dataset and their frequencies. Begin by aggregating your data, convert to [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) for simple plotting, and plot.
"""

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Aggregating data - Complete for Cyclist and Motorist
types_of_crashes = {
    'Pedestrian Injuries': data['NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS INJURED'].sum(),
    'Cyclist Injuries': data['NUMBER OF CYCLIST INJURED'].sum(),

plt.xlabel('Count')
plt.ylabel('Type of crash')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

"""**TO DO:** Analyze the chart above. What is a recommendation you might make to the Department of Transportation based on this data?


> *  Based on this Data, I would recommend the DOT find a relationship between motorist deaths and the type of vehicles in these crashes. It's clear that there has to be a relationship between the high number of sedans in crashes and motorist deaths. It's also important for them to look at the two cars that crash into each other the most; sedans have to be one of them.

##<font color='crimson'> **Milestone #3 - Time Series Analysis**</font>
GOAL: The main goal of this milestone is to dive deeper into Time Series Analysis in order to better understand our data's trends over time.

**Step 1:**

Before we jump into Time Series Analysis (TSA), it's important to understand the basics, including Trends, Seasonality, and Residual Components.

Review one or more of the following resources and tell us what you learned about TSA!

*  [Learn about Time Series patterns here](https://otexts.com/fpp2/tspatterns.html)
* [Learn about Time Plots here](https://otexts.com/fpp2/time-plots.html)
*[Learn how to decompose Time Series Data into Trend and Seasonality](https://machinelearningmastery.com/decompose-time-series-data-trend-seasonality/)

**TO DO:** Write 3-5 sentences about TSA.
> *  Time Series Analysis is analyzing the given data to find certain trends, patterns, and relationships over a period of time. Under TSA, there are different patterns, such as trends, seasonals, and cycles. In short, these are patterns that people categorize their data in. Trends exist when a long-term increase or decrease occurs, similar to a changing direction. A seasonal pattern is a time frame detected by seasonal factors like time and day of the week. Cyclic patterns occur when data rises and falls in a predictive manner. This is similar to a seasonal pattern but is more specific to the time of the year; it is predictable when data rises during a certain time of the year but falls. Decomposing time series allows for a more organized way of forecasting your data into seeing the Seasonal, Residual and Trend patterns.

**Step 2:** Let's begin by creating a chart that displays the average number of crashes per hour of the day. This will help us understand whether additional factors are contributing to crashes - i.e. rush hour, school dismissal time, night fall, etc.

> *  My graph tells me that covid significantly impacted the number of crashes per month, dropping it drastically. Eventually as covid was handled, the amount of crashes increased but at a steady rate below the 10000 line. This could be because during the COVID-19 pandemic, there were less drivers on the road, causing a big drop. Less cars on the road caused fewer road congestions, hence the decrease in crashes.

2. Decomposed Components:
  
    2.1 Trend: This graph shows the long-term trend in the data, which can indicate whether crashes are increasing, decreasing, or stable over time.

    2.2 Seasonality: This reveals any regular patterns that repeat over a specific period, such as yearly. It helps identify times of the year with higher or lower crash frequencies.

    2.3 Residuals: These are the irregular components that cannot be attributed to the trend or seasonality. They might include random or unpredictable fluctuations.

**TO DO:** Based on your *trend graph*, are we seeing an increase or a decrease in crashes between 2014 and 2022?

> *  We are seeing a decrease in crashes between 2014 and 2022.


**TO DO:** Based on your *residual graph*, in what year(s) was there a significant unpredicted fluctuation? Why do you think so?

> *  There was a significant unpredicted fluctuation in 2014 and 2020. These fluctuations might have happened because of external factors that caused an increase in crashes. While I am unsure why crashes might have increased so much in 2014, the COVID-19 pandemic was the reason for such an unexpected change.

##<font color='crimson'>  **Milestone #5 - Self-Guided Research Question**</font>
GOAL: In this Milestone, you will be prompted to take what youâ€™ve learned throughout this project, build your own research question, and create a visualization(s) or model(s) to support your research goals.

You may create your visualization(s) in this Colab Notebook, or in Excel, Tableau, PowerBI, etc. Choose whichever medium you are most comfortable with! Be creative!

For participants who are comfortable with advanced data science techniques, we welcome you to leverage additional datasets, if desired. We highly recommend using pre-cleaned datasets from open data sources, like Kaggle.com.

If you have any questions or get stuck, please email nsdc@nebigdatahub.org with your queries. We're here to help!

**Step 1:** Review the dataset(s) that you will be using. As you explore, [consider the research question you want to answer](https://libraries.indiana.edu/sites/default/files/Develop_a_Research_Question.pdf)! Additionally, think about [who you are telling your data's story to](https://hbr.org/2013/04/how-to-tell-a-story-with-data). Your final audience may contain a group of transportation professionals, data scientists, peers, and the general public. Think about how would you frame your analysis differently for each of these groups.

**TO DO:** List one or more research questions here that you are considering.

> *  How did the COVID pandemic impact the amount of fatalities compared to pre-pandemic?
> *  How do advancements in electric and hybrid transit systems/cars contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting the development environmental-friendly cities?
> *  What role does road design, including bike lanes and bus lanes have on road safety, and what roles do they play in reducing crashes?

**Step 2:** Now, think about what type of analysis you'd like to complete. Are you interested in looking at time series forecasting? Do you have additional maps in mind that you'd like to create? Is there a certain zip code or region you'd like to dive deeper into?

If you happen to be stuck, here are some examples that you can use or can guide you in choosing your research question!

**Examples:**
- How many crashes, injuries, and/or fatalies occurred in a zip code of interest?
- Which zip code sees the highest amount of crashes and what recommendations can you offer to help that community? Is it an underserved community?
- Do more crashes occur in underrepresented communities? Support your conclusion.
- Which day of the week sees the most crashes, injuries, and/or fatalities? (Hint: use the same method we used when we were analyzing the average number of crashes at different times of the day!)
- Does the geometric features of an intersection (90 degree intersection vs skewed intersection) affect the number of crashes that occur?

Be creative and think outside the box!

**Step 3:** Now that you've decided on your transportation research question, [explore the various types of visualizations you can create to support your research](https://datavizcatalogue.com/). You may create visualizations in this Google Colab notebook, Excel, R, SQL, PowerBI, Tableau, etc. Choose a program you are comfortable with!

You may also choose to build a model or leverage a different data science technique based on your experience level.

**Step 4:** Consider the **accessibility** of the graphs, charts, maps, or models you are interested in building. Use the tools below to learn more!
* How does your visualization appear to people [who may not be able to distinguish between muted colors or see your chart at all?](https://chartability.fizz.studio/)
*[Color Contrast Checker](https://policyviz.com/2022/11/01/color-contrast-checker-in-excel/)
*[SAS Graphics Accelerator](https://support.sas.com/software/products/graphics-accelerator/index.html)
*[TwoTone Data Sonification Tool](https://twotone.io/about/)
*[Making Visual Studio Accessible](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/accessibility)

To make visualizations more inclusive for people with color blindness, you can choose a color palette that is colorblind-friendly. `Seaborn`, a Python visualization library, provides several palettes that are designed to be perceptible by those with color vision deficiencies. Seaborn's `cubehelix` palette is a good choice, as it was designed specifically with color blindness in mind.

**Step 5:** Begin your research! Give yourself plenty of time to build your visualization or model. If you have any questions along the way, please email nsdc@nebigdatahub.org or write a message in the #[tdsp-community Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/nsdcorps/shared_invite/zt-1h64t1e2p-La0AgU_HhymWUEGFQEcb3w).

**TO DO:** List the research question(s) you've chosen and why! Maybe you chose this question because it can help a community of interest or because it is similar to research you've completed in a class setting. Share your thoughts below.

> *  What role does road design, including bike lanes and bus lanes have on road safety, and what roles do they play in reducing crashes? We chose this question because it can be a major reason why there are large amounts of fatalities. Since bike lanes and bus lanes make the roads more compact, it effects the flow of traffic and can significantly effect the safety of drivers.

**TO DO:** Build a visualization, model, or use other statistical methods to gain insights into your data and to support your research question.

# I used Tableau to make a pie chart showing the most popular crashes; a better visual to show in my opinion.

##<font color='crimson'>**Milestone #6 - Virtual Poster Board Creation: Data Storytelling**</font>

GOAL: The main goal of this milestone is to create a one page, virtual poster board to portray your research findings and recommendations! Your poster may be shared with the Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Authority.

Within your poster, summarize your research question, your reasoning for selecting your data visualization or model choices, and key insights from your data analysis. You may also wish to include your outstanding research questions that could not be answered by the dataset and why.

**Be sure to answer the following on your virtual poster board:** Based on your research insights, what recommendations would you share with the Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Authority to make roads safer for vulnerable road users? Why?

**Additionally, be sure to cite all relevant sources that you referred to throughout this project on your poster board (MLA or APA citation preferred). List acknowlegdments if you received any support from mentors, professors, professionals, etc. throughout your journey.**

Please use the following resources to get started!


*   [Virtual Poster Board Template](https://nebigdatahub.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Copy-of-dsi-poster.ppt-48-Ã—-36-in.pdf) - Your one-page, virtual poster may be created in PowerPoint, Google Slides, Canva, etc. Choose what you are most comfortable with!
